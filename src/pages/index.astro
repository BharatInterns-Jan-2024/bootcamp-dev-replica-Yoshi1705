In a short time I have already learned a LOT. I love Tailwind CSS, and now that we are beginning the JavaScript portion of the bootcamp, I am even more excited than I was before the class started.

However, this bootcamp is text based, and I find it much more enjoyable to be able to go back and read the material again, I feel I am absorbing the information in a different way. Also, the bootcamp has given me a good structure for learning all the topics that are necessary to become a full stack developer, which would have taken me a very long time to figure out on my own. In addition, the discord community is very friendly, and I have found lots of help and information from the chat.”"

I found this course at the end of May and understood, that is what I really want to learn in the summer, while I was on vacation. I don’t know English very well, and this course was really good to learn it with Flavio. You should be very hardworking to finish that course, because there are a lot of new information, and you need to understand it in a little period of time. At the and or this course you can try to find work, because now you know all concepts of JS, and it is enough to be JS developer.”"

You can always go back and refresh your memory, and you will since it's so full of information, tips and tricks - the curriculum is huge! I am a junior front end for about a year and a half now and yet I found so many details in the course materials that I never learned in a proper way before. Also finally learned and understood the bigger picture of frontend development, not just HTML, CSS and JavaScript but all other things that come into play like npm, webpack, babel, networking, and many other concepts that are missing from most courses I took in the past. Pair that with a very, very low price, multiple discount options, very friendly and helpful instructor Flavio and you have a great deal. Community is also just the right size, not too big, not too small, someone is always there to help you move through curriculum. Flavio also leaves no questions / requests unanswered. ”"

One of the main things I learned: there's so much more you can do with JavaScript today compared to 12 years ago, so it is inevitable to stay up to date. This bootcamp is the right place, because you get information that starts from zero up to advanced modern topics. And the Discord chat gives you the opportunity to discuss with the other participants in order to seek for and provide help or just to chat.

And Flavio provides that knowledge with enough depth to keep you going when the bootcamp is over. The material is well-presented, easy to follow and actually up-to-date. You will learn what is relevant now or, more importantly, what might be essential tomorrow and not what was hot yesterday. There is so much to learn. And it will require further studies on my own. But for the first time I have the feeling that I can get somewhere with an online course, working confidently on the front- and backend, equipped with the knowledge of an up-to-date tech stack. Hence, if you want to become a full-stack JS developer I wholeheartedly recommend this bootcamp!"

While at the time I felt the content was a little basic, in retrospect this is only because Flavio does such a great job of breaking down concepts. I gained so much knowledge about web technologies I was exposed to daily, but knew little about. Even things I did have some knowledge about, like deployment, were enriched through the bootcamp—now I know about other services I can use to deploy apps more quickly as well as knowledge about how to utilize webhooks to continuously deploy to servers I set up. I still use skills I learned from the bootcamp in my current job as a test automation engineer and am often teaching the skills I learned to more junior members of the team too. Thanks Flavio!”"

        quote="“I had the pleasure of attending the Flavio Copes JavaScript bootcamps educational programs in 2021, 2022, and 2023 and found them to be an incredibly valuable learning experience. The program provided clear and concise instruction on important aspects of coding and modern technology, and the practical examples and hands-on projects allowed me to apply what I was learning in real-world examples, which was incredibly valuable to my understanding and skill development.. As a mature professional, the multi-week program was flexible and allowed me to learn at my own pace, which was great for balancing my work and life schedule. Clear step-by-step approach of the program, focused on important aspects of coding and current tools and services, has made the learning process manageable and enjoyable for me. The community aspect of the program was also a major plus, as it provided a supportive and encouraging environment for learning and growth. Overall, I would highly recommend the JavaScript bootcamp to anyone looking to improve their skills and knowledge in the world of coding.”"

This means you have accountability and motivation. Make friends with your fellow class mates to get the most out of the bootcamp, and challenge each other! How many Udemy courses did you buy but never followed through after the first couple lessons? There's no way this bootcamp will end up like the dozens of courses you purchased but never finished."

        text="It depends, but I estimate about 1 or 2 hours every week day. Or do 3/4 hours on weekend days. If you do more, it's better because the more time you study, the more things will stick. But that's a start. It's not super intensive, it's a marathon, not a sprint."

The only thing I ask is to stay on top of the weekly schedule, meaning I will release a new module on Tuesday, complete it by next Tuesday when a new module will unlock. Most students will follow the schedule and you'll find more activity and community support, because everyone is doing those lessons along with you. This is the best way to stay on top of the schedule and complete the bootcamp successfully."

        text="Yes, they will be yours forever."

        title="Can I follow the bootcamp at my own pace?"
        text="Yes! I do unlock 1 new module every week but there is no problem in going a bit slower. Some people have more time, some less. There's no problem, although I see more success rates in students that stay on top of the schedule."

        title="What are the prerequisites?"
        text="I assume some basic knowledge on how the web works, HTML, CSS, some JavaScript basics. If you're not sure, you can ask me and I can help you understand if you're ready for the bootcamp"

        title="I joined the 2020/2021/2022/2023 cohort. Is this bootcamp different? Can I join again?"
        text="Compared to previous editions, in 2024 I have rewritten 100% of the material. The bootcamp is a completely new course compared to past editions, so if you want to learn the new material, you should join again. I will have a discount for you since you joined the bootcamp in the past."

        title="What time of day are the lessons?"
        text="The bootcamp is not live. We'll have students from New Zealand, Nigeria, Brazil, United States, Norway, India.. all over the world! So it's impossible to find hours that work for everyone. Instead, the bootcamp is asynchronous. You pick the hours that best suit your schedule, and you connect to the students Discord chat where you'll always find people you can talk to, to discuss ideas or clarify some concepts together."

        title="Is the training instructor led?  How does it work?"
        text="I (Flavio Copes) built the entire curriculum, lessons and projects. I will unlock access to a new lessons module each week. It's not like in school where I'll have lectures. Instead, you find the lessons on a web page and you go through each lesson on your own. The content will be text based. The particular thing about the bootcamp cohort is that you're studying privately, but you're not on your own. You'll have other students you can talk to, ask questions, help each other. All of them are doing the same things you're doing now. And I (the instructor) will be in the Discord chat as much as possible to help everyone during the bootcamp, so that no one gets left behind and we can all complete the course successfully"
